# What is this project?

A cards against humanity clone that is written with modern technology and designed to be fast and bug-free. It has automated tests, and tests at every level to ensure this.

# Technology Used

There a Go backend, and a SolidJs frontend that communicate by sending JSON over a websocket. Tests are done using go-rod (browser wrapper, think selenium), vitest, and go testify.
A makefile is used to run things in the correct order, and docker compose is used to setup a test environment for testing.

All of the card packs are stored in a submodule - see ./packs/

# Wiki

When I get around to it, a markdown wiki will be made under ./wiki/, the assets used are generated by tests and stored in git history to track and visual changes.
